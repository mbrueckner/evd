Simulation of various sequential two- and multi-arm clinical trial designs with Day-14 survival rate as primary endpoint. Designs include classic frequentist group-sequential design, Bayesian group-sequential design, frequentist multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) design, Bayesian MAMS and Bayesian response-adaptive design.

The data is simulated from parametric flexible spline model fitted to a real data set from the 2014 West Africa Ebola Virus Disease epidemic.
